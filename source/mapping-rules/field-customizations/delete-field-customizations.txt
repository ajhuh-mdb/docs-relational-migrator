You can delete customized fields. This process resets the data type 
value of a field to data type originally assigned by Relational 
Migrator.

Before you Begin
----------------

You need to have a :ref:`customized field <rm-add-customized-fields>` 
in order to delete a customization.

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`schema model` pane or diagram view.

#. On the :guilabel:`schema model` pane on the right-side of the screen, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon next to a mapping rule.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`chevron-left` icon next to the field 
   you want to delete the field customization.

   .. note::

      You can view a field's :guilabel:`Original name` and 
      :guilabel:`Original type` in the expanded customized field menu.

#. Click on the drop-down for :guilabel:`BSON type`.

#. Select the option that has :guilabel:`(default)` next to the data type
   name. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.

The updated field customizations are visible in MongoDB after your 
next sync job runs.
