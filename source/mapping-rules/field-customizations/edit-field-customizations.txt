You have the option to edit customized fields. Consider 
making edits to field customizations to accommodate specific 
requirements such as indexing, schema adjustments, or field renaming.

About this Task
---------------

If you edit a customized field data type and you haven't enabled the 
:guilabel:`Drop destination collections before migration` option for 
your sync job, the documents fields get replaced with 
the data types from the updated customized field settings when the next
sync job runs.

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`schema model` pane or diagram view.

#. On the :guilabel:`schema model` pane on the right-side of the screen, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`chevron-left` icon next to the field 
   you want to customize.

#. Edit the field customization, you can:

   - Change a fields :guilabel:`BSON type`.
   - Change a fields :guilabel:`Null handlings` option.
   - Change a fields name.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.

The updated field customizations are visible in MongoDB after your 
next sync job runs.
