You can use field customizations to convert your source relational column 
data types into customized MongoDB field :ref:`BSON data types <bson-types>`.

Use Cases
---------

You can use field customization to:

- Change a source relational datatype to a specific MongoDB BSON datatype.
- Customize ``_id`` fields using JavaScript expressions.
- Configure :guilabel:`Null Handelings` behavior.
- Rename your collection names.

Behavior
--------

- Your customized fields which cause errors during a sync job, are added
  as a ``BsonNull``. Sync jobs continue even with errors unless the 
  user-defined threshold is reached.

- You can transform a ``id`` field into a calculated field. These 
  changes can be reverted at anytime and the ``_id`` field returns to 
  the default ``object_id`` type.

- Field customizations are optional components of your mapping rules. A 
  default data type is assigned to your MongoDB fields which most 
  closely matches your source data type. Field customization give you 
  the option to customize your MongoDB schema.
