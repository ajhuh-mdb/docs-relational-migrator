You can use Field Customizations to convert your source relational data 
types into customized MongoDB BSON data types.

Use Cases
---------

You can use field customization to:

- Change a source relational datatype to a specific MongoDB BSON datatype.
- Custom ``_id`` fields, ``_id`` fields can be customized and translated
  as data dype besides ``object_id``.
- Configure :guilabel:`Null Handelings` behavior.
- Rename source table names.

Behavior
--------

- Your customized fields which cause errors during a sync job, are added
  as a ``BsonNull``. Sync jobs continue even with errors unless the 
  user-defined threshold is reached.

- You can transform a ``id`` field into a calculated field. These 
  changes can be reverted at anytime and the ``_id`` field returns to 
  the default ``object_id`` type.
