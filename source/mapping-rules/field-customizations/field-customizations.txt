Field customizations are optional components of your mapping rules that 
allow you to convert your source relational column data types into a 
customized :ref:`BSON data type <bson-types>`. 

Relational Migrator assigns a default data type to your MongoDB fields 
that most closely matches the source column data type. Field customization 
gives you the ability to change the destination data type to fine-tune 
your schema.

Use Cases
---------

You can use field customization to:

- Change a source relational datatype to a specific MongoDB BSON datatype.
- Customize ``_id`` fields using JavaScript expressions.
- Configure :guilabel:`Null Handelings` behavior.
- Rename your collections.

Behavior
--------

- Your customized fields which cause errors during a sync job, are added
  follow the :guilabel:`Null Handelings` behavior you have defined for 
  that field. Sync jobs continue even with errors unless the 
  user-defined threshold is reached.

- You can transform a ``id`` field into a calculated field. These 
  changes can be reverted at anytime and the ``_id`` field returns to 
  the default ``object_id`` type.

- Supported BSON data types include:
   - Boolean
   - Date
   - Decimal
   - Double
   - Integer
   - Long
   - String

   .. note::

      Some data type conversions may result in errors in your sync job. For
      example, converting certain ``String`` values to a date. See :ref:`rm-field-customization-example`
      for details.
