You can update a mapping rule after it is created. Edited mapping rules take 
effect the next time a sync job is run.

About this Task
---------------

Options available on the :guilabel:`edit` pane depend on the type of 
mapping rule you are editing. For an overview of each mapping rule 
option see:

- :ref:`New Documents <rm-new-documents>`

- :ref:`Embedded Array <rm-embedded-array>`

- :ref:`Embedded Documents <rm-embedded-documents>`

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`schema model` pane or diagram view.

#. On the :guilabel:`schema model` pane on the right-side of the screen, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon.

#. Edit the mapping rule, when editing a mapping rule you can:

   - Edit the collection name. 
   - Edit field names.
   - Include or exclude a field from your sync job by clicking the 
     :icon-fa5:`check-square` next to the field name.

#. (Optional) Add field customizations to your mapping rule:

   I. Click the :icon-fa5:`chevron-left` icon next to the field 
      you want to customize.

   II. Select a :guilabel:`BSON type`.

   III. Select a :guilabel:`Null handlings` option.

   - :guilabel:`Insert as null` preserves null values, and nulls 
      are inserted into your destination collection.
   - :guilabel:`Omit` skips any null values, and nulls are not 
      inserted into the destination collection.

   You can view a field's :guilabel:`Original name` and 
   :guilabel:`Original type` in the expanded customized field menu.

   .. note::

      For additional details on field customization and data type conversions,
      see :ref:`field customizations <rm-field-customizations>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close` button to save your edits.
