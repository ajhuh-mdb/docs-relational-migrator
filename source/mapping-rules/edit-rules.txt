You can update a mapping rule after it is created. Edited mapping rules take 
effect the next time a sync job is run.

About this Task
---------------

Options available on the :guilabel:`edit` pane depend on the type of 
mapping rule you are editing. For an overview of each mapping rule 
option see:

- :ref:`New Documents <rm-new-documents>`

- :ref:`Embedded Array <rm-embedded-array>`

- :ref:`Embedded Documents <rm-embedded-documents>`

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`schema model` pane or diagram view.

#. On the :guilabel:`schema model` pane on the right-side of the screen, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon. The :guilabel:`Edit mapping` 
   pane opens.

#. Edit the mapping rule.

   You can edit the destination collection name, field names, and 
   include or exclude a field from your sync jobs by
   clicking the checkbox next to the field name.

#. **(Optional)** You can also add :ref:`calculated fields <rm-calculated-fields>` 
   and :ref:`rm-id-field-customizations` when you 
   edit a mapping rule. To add field customization to your mapping rule:

   I. Click the :icon-fa5:`chevron-left` icon next to the field 
      you want to customize.

   II. Select a :guilabel:`BSON type`.

   III. Select a :guilabel:`Null handlings` option.

      - :guilabel:`Omit` - null values are not inserted into your 
        destination collection.
      - :guilabel:`Insert as null` - null values are inserted into the destination
        collection. 

   .. note::

      You can view a field's :guilabel:`Original name` and 
      :guilabel:`Original type` in the expanded customized field menu.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close` button to save your edits.
