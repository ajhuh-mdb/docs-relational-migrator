You can configure mapping rules to migrate a table that contains a date 
time column as a :ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`. 
Time series collections efficiently store time series data. In time 
series collections, writes are organized so that data from the same 
source is stored alongside other data points from a similar point in time.

About this Task
---------------

Compared to normal collections, storing time series data in time series
collections improves query efficiency and reduces the disk usage for
time series data and :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>`.

Before you Begin
----------------

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Select a collection with a datetime field 
      
      a. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Schema model`
      #. Click on a collection that has a date time field under 
         the :guilabel:`MongoDB` header.

   .. step:: Configure the time-series collection
     
      a. On the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane, click the :guilabel:`Configure`
         button.
      #. Select the :guilabel:`Time Series Collection` radio button.
      #. Select a :guilabel:`Time Field`.
      #. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Meta Field`.
      #. Select a :guilabel:`Granularity`.
      #. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Expire After Seconds`.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Save And Close`.

         .. note::

            Once a collection is configured with at time field, the 
            :icon-lg:`TimeSeries` icon displays under the 
            :guilabel:`MongoDB`
