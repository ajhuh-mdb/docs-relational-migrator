You can customize fields when adding or editing your mapping rules. 
Relational Migrator allows you to define custom fields using 
:ref:`rm-calculated-fields`, define custom ids using 
:ref:`rm-id-field-customizations`, or convert your source 
relational column data types into :ref:`a supported BSON data type<rm-field-supported-types>`.

Use Cases
---------

You can use field customization to:

- Change a source relational datatype to a specific MongoDB BSON datatype.
- Customize ``_id`` fields using JavaScript expressions.
- Customize a field using JavaScript expressions.
- Configure null handling behavior.
- Change field names.

Behavior
--------

Relational Migrator assigns a default data type to your MongoDB fields 
that most closely matches the source column data type. Field customization 
gives you the ability to change the MongoDB field data type to a different 
data type to fine-tune your schema.

Customized fields which cause errors during a sync job continue until
the user-defined maximum error threshold gets reached.

:guilabel:`Null Handlings` allow you to specify the behavior 
of ``Null`` values. You can omit these values or include 
them in your destination collections.

.. _rm-field-supported-types:

Supported Data Types
--------------------

Customized fields support the following BSON data types:

- Boolean
- Date
- Decimal
- Double
- Integer
- Long
- String

.. warning::

   Some data type conversions may result in errors in your sync job. For
   details, see :ref:`conversion examples<rm-data-type-conversion-guide>`.
