You can customize a ``_id`` field as part of your sync job.
Customized ``_id`` fields allow you to change a fields BSON data type 
and write custom JavaScript expressions instead of using the projects
:ref:`Key Handling Option <rm-key-handling-setting>`.
Customized ``_id`` fields **must** evaluate to a unique value.

Use Cases
---------

You may want to use customized ``_id`` fields to make your ``_id`` field
more expressive, such as including multiple fields concatenated to form
a unique ``_id``.

About this Task
---------------

You can revert the custom id changes at anytime and the ``_id`` field returns to 
the default :ref:`object_id type <document-bson-type-object-id>`.

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`schema model` pane or diagram view.

#. On the :guilabel:`schema model` pane on the right-side of the screen, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon next to a mapping rule.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-v` icon next to the :guilabel:`_id` field
   and select :guilabel:`Transform to calculated field`.

#. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`BSON type`.

#. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Null handlings` option.

   - :guilabel:`Omit` - null values are not inserted into your 
     destination collection.
   - :guilabel:`Insert as null` - null values are inserted into the destination
     collection. 

#. Enter a valid JavaScript expression. For examples, see 
   :ref:`valid JavaScript expression<calculated-field-examples>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Done`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.

The next time that you run a sync job, the deleted field is not updated
in the MongoDB collection.
