You can sign in to your Atlas account inside Relational Migrator. When 
you log in with your Atlas account in Relational Migrator, you can 
access the :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>` feature.

Before you Begin
----------------

To log in with Atlas, you must have an existing :atlas:`Atlas account 
</tutorial/create-atlas-account>` and a 
:atlas:`deployment </create-connect-deployments>`. 

About this Task
---------------

- To log in with your Atlas account, Relational Migrator must be running 
  on localhost on one of the following ports: 

  - ``8278``
  - ``8080``
  - ``443``

- If you run Relational Migrator on ports not listed above, 
  the sign-in process fails.

- You might need to reauthenticate when your session token expires. To 
  reauthenticate to your Atlas account, follow the same log in procedure 
  below.
