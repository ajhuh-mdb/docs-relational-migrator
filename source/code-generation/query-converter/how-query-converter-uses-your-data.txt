==================================

Query Converter currently uses the `Azure OpenAI Service
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft. 

When you use Query Converter, the following information is sent to 
MongoDB's backend and the third party AI provider:

- The full text of your query or stored procedure.
- The definition of any relational database tables used in the query.
  These definitions include the table names, column names, data types,
  and any primary or foreign keys relationships.
- The definition of your MongoDB collections and mapping rules. 
  These definitions include the relationships between the collections 
  and tables used in the query and the collection names, field names 
  and data types.

The information that is sent is not shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. Relational Migrator does not send 
database connection strings, credentials, or any raw data from your 
databases.

By default, your original query text and the AI-converted query 
telemetry data is stored by MongoDB for up to one year to help us 
provide support to customers and improve the service. If you do not want
your data to be stored, you have the option to opt out:

- You can disable the :guilabel:`Allow queries to be stored temporarily` 
  toggle switch in global project settings.
- You can uncheck the :guilabel:`Allow MongoDB to temporarily store the 
  source and converted queries to import the product feature` setting 
  when enabling query converter.

Disable Query Converter
-----------------------

Query Converter is available in the Relational Migrator UI once you
have clicked the :guilabel:`Use Query Converter` button. If you no 
longer want to use the feature, you can ignore it and no data will be 
sent to Generative AI models. If needed, you can hide the feature by 
clearing all browser data for the Relational Migrator host.
