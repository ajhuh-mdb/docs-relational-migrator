You can import and convert your SQL triggers to 
:ref:`MongoDB Atlas Triggers <atlas-triggers>` with the query converter. 
The query converter considers the SQL code and relational schema defined 
in your project when converting your triggers.

Before you Begin
----------------

Your relational database must have at least one trigger defined in order
to use query converter trigger conversion.

Steps
-----


.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Navigate to the query converter pane

  	   From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Open the query converter view

      -  If it is your first time using the query converter in your
         project, click :guilabel:`Import From Database`.

      -  If your project already has converted SQL code, click the
         :guilabel:`Manage Database Objects` button on the left-hand
         pane.

   


Example
-------

Optional.

In some cases, you can work through a specific example throughout the steps. 
In others, it is helpful to show a complete example at the end. In most cases, 
it's helpful to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It 
could be a brief description, code block, or screenshot.
