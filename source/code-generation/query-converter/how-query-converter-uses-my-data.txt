Query Converter currently uses the Azure OpenAI Service hosted by 
Microsoft. 

How your data is used
---------------------

When you use Query Converter, the following information is sent to 
MongoDB's backend and/or the third party AI provider:

- The full text of your query or stored procedure 
- The definition of any relational database tables used in the query 
  (table names, column names and types, primary and foreign keys)
- The definition of your MongoDB collections and mapping rules linked 
  to the tables used in the query (including collection names, 
  field names and types)

The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send database 
connection strings, credentials, or rows/documents from your databases. 

By default, your original query text and the AI-converted query will be 
stored by MongoDB for up to one year to help us provide support to 
customers and improve the service. If you do not want your data to be 
stored, you can opt out by

Disabling Query Converter
-------------------------

Query Converter is available in the Relational Migrator UI once you
have clicked the “Use Query Converter” button. If you no longer wish to 
use the feature, you can ignore it and no data will be sent to 
Generative AI models. If needed, you can hide the feature by clearing 
all browser data for the Relational Migrator host.
