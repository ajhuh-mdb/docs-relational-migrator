You can use the query converter to convert SQL statements, views, and 
stored procedures to MongoDB syntax. The query converter considers the 
mapping rules and schema transformations defined in your project when converting
your SQL code.

Before you Begin
----------------

The query converter feature is in private 
preview. To request private preview access, use the sign-up form within the
Relational Migrator application. For instructions, see 
:ref:`rm-query-converter`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the query converter pane

      From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the 
      :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Read the user agreement

   .. step:: Enable the query converter feature

      Click :guilabel:`Use Query Converter`. 
      The :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane displays.

   .. step:: (Optional) Disable telemetry

      Telemetry data about the source and converted queries are 
      temporarily stored by MongoDB to improve the query converter 
      feature. You can disable sending telemetry data by unchecking the 
      :guilabel:`Allow MongoDB to temporarily store source and coverted 
      queries to improve the product feature`
      check box.

         toggle switch in global project settings.
