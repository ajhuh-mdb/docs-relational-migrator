You can use the query converter to convert SQL statements, views, and 
stored procedures to MongoDB syntax. The query converter considers the 
mapping rules and schema transformations defined in your project when converting
your SQL code.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the query converter pane

      From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the 
      :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Read the user agreement

   .. step:: (Optional) Review telemetry preferences

      Telemetry data about the source and converted queries are 
      temporarily stored by MongoDB to improve the query converter 
      feature. You can disable sending telemetry data by unchecking the 
      :guilabel:`Allow MongoDB to temporarily store source and coverted 
      queries to improve the product feature`
      check box.

      .. note::

         You can also disable telemetry data by toggling the 
         :guilabel:`Allow queries to be stored temporarily` 
         switch in the global project settings.

   .. step:: Enable the query converter feature

      Click :guilabel:`Start Using Query Converter`. 
      The :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane is displayed.
