Relational Migrator can recover continuous (CDC) sync jobs that 
have failed within a 24-hour period. Procedures 
for recovering a CDC sync job depend on if your using the embedded 
or Kafka deployment mode.

Embedded Mode Recovery
----------------------

For embedded mode recovery, the process to recover
a sync job is manually triggered. Navigate to the 
:guilabel:`Data Migration` tab and click 
:guilabel:`Resume` on the failed CDC sync job. 

Examples of embedded mode recoverable scenarios include:

- Unexpected application failure
- Operating system restarts

Kafka Deployment Mode Recovery
------------------------------

For the Kafka deployment mode recovery, the process to recover
a sync job is automatic. Kafka health checks automatically 
attempt to resume CDC sync jobs after a failure of 
individual `Kafka brokers <https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-kafka/brokers/>`__
for up to 24-hours.

Examples of Kafka CDC sync job recoverable scenarios include:

- Loss of individual brokers in Kafka cluster
- Application-level issues resulting in failed health check
