Relational Migrator can attempt to recover continuous (CDC) sync jobs 
that have failed within the preceding 24-hour period. 
The procedure for recovering a CDC sync job differs, 
depending on whether you're using the embedded or Kafka deployment 
mode. For details on each job type, see :ref:`rm-sync-jobs`.

About this Task
---------------

CDC sync job recovery depends on the type of deployment 
mode your using. The following table summarizes the modes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode
     - Description

   * - Embedded Mode
     - Sync jobs that are running on a :ref:`local machine <local-machine-install>` or 
       a :ref:`unattended server <unattended-server>`.

   * - Kafka Mode
     - Sync jobs that are running with :ref:`Kafka support <kafka-intro>`.

Click the tab to display the recovery procedure 
for each deployment mode:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Embedded Mode
      :tabid: embedded-mode

      For embedded mode recovery, the process to restart
      a sync job is manually trigger. Navigate to the 
      :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab and click 
      :guilabel:`Resume` on the failed sync job. 

      Examples of embedded mode recoverable scenarios include:

      - Unexpected application failure
      - Operating system restarts

   .. tab:: Kafka Deployment
      :tabid: kafka-deployment

      For the Kafka deployment mode recovery, the process to recover
      a sync job is automatic. Kafka health checks automatically 
      attempt to resume CDC sync jobs after a failure of 
      individual `Kafka brokers <https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-kafka/brokers/>`__
      for up to 24-hours.

      Examples of Kafka CDC sync job recoverable scenarios include:

      - Loss of individual brokers in Kafka cluster
      - Application-level issues resulting in failed health checks
