You can delete existing table filters.
Deleting table filters remove SQL where and row limit clauses
when pulling data from your table.

Before you Begin
----------------

- Table filters are applied while you are creating mapping rules. See 
  :ref:`<create-rule-relational>` for more details.

- You can apply one filter per table. Each filter can have a SQL where 
  clause, a row limit clause, or both.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Apply a table filter

      #. From the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane, click the table 
         that you want to apply a filter to.
      #. On the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane in the :guilabel:`Table Filter` 
         section click :icon-lg:`Trash` icon next to the filter you want
         to delete.

   .. step:: Confirm deletion of your table filter

      Click the red :guilabel:`Delete` button to confirm deletion of 
      the table filter.

      The table filter begins deleting, it could take a few seconds 
      for the table filter to disappear from the GUI.
